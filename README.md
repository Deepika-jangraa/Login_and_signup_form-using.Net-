## Introduction
The Login and Signup Form project is a web application developed using .NET. It provides users with the ability to create an account (signup) and then login securely using their registered credentials. The project follows the best practices for security and data handling.

## Technologies Used
The project utilizes the following technologies:

.NET Framework: Version X.X
C#: Programming language for backend development
ASP.NET: Web framework for building web applications
HTML, CSS, JavaScript: Frontend technologies for user interface
Entity Framework: ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) tool for working with databases
SQL Server: Database management system to store user data

## Project Setup
To set up the project on your local machine, follow these steps:

Open the solution file (.sln) in Visual Studio or any compatible IDE.
Make sure you have the required version of .NET Framework installed.
Restore NuGet packages used in the project.
Set up the database connection string in the appsettings.json or web.config file, depending on the type of project.
Run the application using the IDE's built-in web server or deploy it to a hosting server.

## Features
The Login and Signup Form project offers the following features:

Signup: Users can create a new account by providing their email address and password. The password is securely hashed before storage.
Login: Registered users can log in using their email address and password. The login process is securely managed to prevent unauthorized access.
Password Reset: In case of a forgotten password, users can initiate a password reset process. An email with a reset link is sent to the registered email address.
Validation: Client-side and server-side validation is implemented to ensure data integrity and prevent common vulnerabilities like SQL injection and XSS (Cross-Site Scripting).
Authentication: The project uses a secure authentication mechanism to verify user credentials and grant access to authorized users only.
Session Management: User sessions are managed securely to maintain login state and prevent unauthorized access to protected resources.

Signup: Access the signup page, enter a valid email address and password, and submit the form to create a new account.
Login: Access the login page, enter the registered email address and password, and submit the form to log in to the system.
